## Hi there 👋

My name is Nikolaos Kalampalikis, and I’m a Software Engineer with about 2 years of experience in full-stack and backend development. Most recently, I worked as a Software Engineer II at Boomi, where I contributed to a Java-based microservice and later focused on building reusable web components to enhance UI consistency. I hold a Master’s in Applied Mathematics and a Bachelor’s in Computer Science from Worcester Polytechnic Institute, where I also gained hands-on experience through internships at 128 Technology and Pivotal Software.

- 🔭 I’m currently on a sabbatical in Greece, working on a Sudoku solver app  
- 🌱 I’m diving deeper into React and REST architecture  
- 💬 Ask me about math, algorithms, or puzzles — I'd be happy to help!
