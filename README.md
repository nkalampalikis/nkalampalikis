## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Nikolaos Kalampalikis, and Iâ€™m a software engineer with about 2 years of experience in full-stack and backend development. Most recently, I worked as a Software Engineer II at Boomi, where I contributed to a Java-based microservice and later focused on building reusable web components to enhance UI consistency.

I hold a Masterâ€™s in Applied Mathematics and a Bachelorâ€™s in Computer Science from Worcester Polytechnic Institute, where I also gained hands-on experience through internships at 128 Technology and Pivotal Software.

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently on a sabbatical in Greece, working on a Sudoku solver app  
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m diving deeper into React and REST architecture  
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about math, algorithms, or puzzles â€” I'd be happy to help!
