## Hi there 👋

I’m Nikolaos Kalampalikis, a Software Engineer with experience in backend and full-stack development. I am currently serving in the Hellenic Army’s Informatics Unit as a Software Engineer, working on large-scale internal systems and backend services.

Previously, I worked as a Software Engineer II at Boomi, where I contributed to a Spring Boot–based microservice and later focused on building reusable web components to improve UI consistency across teams. I hold a Master’s in Applied Mathematics and a Bachelor’s in Computer Science from Worcester Polytechnic Institute, and gained additional industry experience through internships at 128 Technology and Pivotal Software.

- 🔭 I’m currently on a sabbatical in Greece, serving in the military
- 🌱 I’m diving deeper into Spring Boot and REST architecture  
- 💬 Ask me about math, algorithms, or puzzles — I'd be happy to help!
